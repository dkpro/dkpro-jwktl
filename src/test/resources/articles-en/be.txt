===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm}} {{term|been||to be|lang=enm}}, from {{etyl|ang}} {{term|beon|bēon|to be, become|lang=ang}}, from {{proto|Germanic|beunan|to be, exist, come to be, become|lang=en}}, from {{proto|Indo-European|bheu-|to grow, become, come into being, appear|lang=en}}. Cognate with {{etyl|fry|-}} {{term|binne||are|lang=fry}}, {{etyl|nl|-}} {{term|ben||am|lang=nl}}, Low German ''bün'' (&quot;am&quot;), {{etyl|de|-}} {{term|bin||am|lang=de}}, {{etyl|ang|-}} {{term|buan|būan|to live, wone|lang=ang}}. Irregular forms are inherited from the {{etyl|ang}} compound verb {{term|beon-wesan|bēon-wesan|lang=ang}}.

====Quotations====
{{seeCites}}

====Inflection====
* The verb {{term||be|lang=en}} is the most irregular non-defective verb in Standard English. Unlike other verbs, which distinguish at most five forms (as in {{term||do|lang=en}}–{{term||does|lang=en}}–{{term||doing|lang=en}}–{{term||did|lang=en}}–{{term||done|lang=en}}), {{term||be|lang=en}} distinguishes eight:
** {{term||Be|lang=en}} itself is the plain form, used as the infinitive, as the imperative, and as the present subjunctive.
**: ''I want to '''be''' a father someday.'' (infinitive)
**: ''That '''be''' the only reason.'' (infinitive)
**: ''Let the truth '''be''' heard!'' (infinitive)
**: ''Please '''be''' here by eight o'clock.'' (imperative)
**: ''The librarian asked that the rare books not '''be''' touched.'' (present subjunctive)
** {{term|am|Am|lang=en}}, {{term|are|lang=en}}, and {{term|is|lang=en}} are the forms of the present indicative. {{term||Am|lang=en}} is the first-person singular (used with {{term||I|lang=en}}); {{term||is|lang=en}} is the third-person singular (used with {{term||he|lang=en}}, {{term||she|lang=en}}, {{term||it|lang=en}} and other subjects that would be used with {{term||does|lang=en}} rather than {{term||do|lang=en}}); and {{term||are|lang=en}} is both the second-person singular and the plural (used with {{term||we|lang=en}}, {{term||you|lang=en}}, {{term||they|lang=en}}, and any other plural subjects).
**: '''''Am''' I in the right place?'' (first-person singular present indicative)
**: ''You '''are''' even taller than your brother!'' (second-person singular present indicative)
**: ''Where '''is''' the library?'' (third-person singular present indicative)
**: ''These '''are''' the biggest shoes we have.'' (plural present indicative)
** {{term|was|Was|lang=en}} and {{term|were|lang=en}} are the forms of the past indicative and past subjunctive (like {{term||did|lang=en}}). In the past indicative, {{term||was|lang=en}} is the first– and third-person singular (used with {{term||I|lang=en}}, as well as with {{term||he|lang=en}}, {{term||she|lang=en}}, {{term||it|lang=en}} and other subjects that would be used with {{term||does|lang=en}} rather than {{term||do|lang=en}}), and {{term||were|lang=en}} is both the second-person singular and the plural (used with {{term||we|lang=en}}, {{term||you|lang=en}}, {{term||they|lang=en}}, and any other plural subjects). In the traditional past subjunctive, {{term||were|lang=en}} is used with all subjects, though many speakers do not actually distinguish the past subjunctive from the past indicative, and therefore use {{term||was|lang=en}} with first– and third-person singular subjects even in cases where other speakers would use {{term||were|lang=en}}.
**: ''I '''was''' out of town.'' (first-person singular past indicative)
**: ''You '''were''' the first person here.'' (second-person singular past indicative)
**: ''The room '''was''' dirty.'' (third-person singular past indicative)
**: ''We '''were''' angry at each other.'' (plural past indicative)
**: ''I wish I '''were''' more sure.'' (first-person singular past subjunctive; ''was'' is also possible)
**: ''If she '''were''' here, she would know what to do.'' (third-person singular past subjunctive; ''was'' is also possible)
** {{term|being|Being|lang=en}} is the gerund-participle, used in noun-like constructions, in the progressive aspect, and after various verbs (like {{term||doing|lang=en}}). (It's also used as an actual noun; for those senses, see the entry for {{term|being|lang=en}} itself.)
**: ''I don't like '''being''' here.''
**: ''All of a sudden, he's '''being''' nice to everyone.''
**: ''It won't stop '''being''' a problem until someone does something about it.''
** {{term|been|Been|lang=en}} is the past participle, used in the perfect aspect.
**: ''It's '''been''' that way for a week and a half.''
* The forms {{term||am|lang=en}}, {{term||is|lang=en}}, and {{term||are|lang=en}} can contract with preceding subjects: {{term|I'm|I’m|I am|lang=en}}, {{term|'s|’s|is|lang=en}}, {{term|'re|’re|are|lang=en}}. The form {{term||are|lang=en}} most commonly contracts with personal pronouns ({{term|we're|we’re|we are|lang=en}}, {{term|you're|you’re|you are|lang=en}}, {{term|they're|they’re|they are|lang=en}}), but contractions with other subjects is possible; the form {{term||is|lang=en}} contracts quite freely with a variety of subjects. These contracted forms, however, are possible only when there is an explicit, non-preposed complement, and they cannot be stressed; therefore, contraction does not occur in sentences such as the following:
**: ''Who's here? —I '''am'''.''
**: ''I wonder what it '''is'''.''
**: ''I don't want to be involved. —But you '''''are''''' involved, regardless.''
* Several of {{term||be|lang=en}}’s finite forms have special negative forms, containing the suffix {{term|-n't|-n’t|lang=en}}, that can be used instead of adding the adverb {{term|not|lang=en}}. Specifically, the forms {{term||is|lang=en}}, {{term||are|lang=en}}, {{term||was|lang=en}}, and {{term||were|lang=en}} have the negative forms {{term|isn't|isn’t|lang=en}}, {{term|aren't|aren’t|lang=en}}, {{term|wasn't|wasn’t|lang=en}}, and {{term|weren't|weren’t|lang=en}}. The form {{term||be|lang=en}} itself does not, even in finite uses, with “not be” being used in the present subjunctive and “do not be” or “don’t be” (or, in dated use, “be not”) being used in the imperative. The form {{term||am|lang=en}} has the negative forms {{term|aren't|aren’t|lang=en}}, {{term|amn't|amn’t|lang=en}}, and arguably {{term|ain't|ain’t|lang=en}}, but all of these are in restricted use; see their entries for details.
* Outside of Standard English, there is some variation in usage of some forms; some dialects, for example, use {{term||is|lang=en}} or {{term||’s|lang=en}} throughout the present indicative (supplanting, in whole or in part, {{term||am|lang=en}} and {{term||are|lang=en}}), and/or {{term||was|lang=en}} throughout the past indicative and past subjunctive (supplanting {{term||were|lang=en}}).
