Summary
-------

JWKTL (Java-based Wiktionary Library) is an application programming 
interface for the free  multilingual online dictionary Wiktionary
(http://www.wiktionary.org). Wiktionary is collaboratively constructed 
by volunteers and continually growing. JWKTL enables efficient and 
structured access to the information encoded in the English and the
 German Wiktionary language editions, including sense definitions, 
 part of speech tags, etymology, example sentences, translations, 
 semantic relations, and many other lexical information types. The 
 API was first described in an LREC 2008 paper.
